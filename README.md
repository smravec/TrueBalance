# Team TrueBalance â€“ VAT Deduction Assistant 

Manually checking whether an invoice is VAT-deductible is a slow and frustrating workflow: open the invoice, cross-check tax codes, search through vero.fi, and still risk making a mistake.  

**Our hackathon project automates this entire process.**  
1. The tool reads a PDF invoice.  
2. The data is sent into a **Voiceflow-powered AI agent**.  
3. Behind the scenes, we built a **(RAG) database** on top of the Finnish tax code from vero.fi.  
4. The AI agent reasons over the rules and returns a simple answer: *deductible or not deductible*.  

This transforms hours of searching and second-guessing into a process that takes only a few minutes-and makes tax paperwork much less boring.
